Major Control Improvements:

Slower Base Speed - Reduced from 3.5 to 2 for better precision
Much Higher Friction - Increased from 0.95 to 0.88 so the car stops much faster
Slower Turning - Cut turning speed in half (0.03 instead of 0.05) for precise steering
Gentler Boost - Reduced boost power from 5 to 3 so it's not overwhelming
Lower Max Speed - Capped at 5 instead of 8 so you won't lose control
Now the car should feel much more like driving a regular car - it responds quickly to your inputs, stops faster when you let go, and the turning is smooth and predictable. You'll have way more control over where you're going! Give it a try! 🎮
